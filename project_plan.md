## Status
- **Gmail PDF filtering by sender is complete.**
- **Next:** Implement downloading and storing PDF attachments, then parsing/analyzing PDF content.

## Next Steps
1. Implement endpoint and service logic to download and store PDF attachments locally.
2. Add logic to parse and analyze PDF content (Phase 2).
3. Continue with OpenAI integration and task management features.
